NEON-Login README UPDATED: OCT 11, 2012
=====================================
NEON-Login is a base version of NEON-CP
which includes just the:

- Login
- Logout
- Database Connections
- Settings
- Registration
- Template & JQuery Files

=====================================
SETUP DIRECTIONS AS FOLLOWS:
=====================================
1. Create a database for the user data
and a user that can access it.

2. Move config.example to one directory
below your root directory. As an example:

If your site is in /var/www/
Put config.example in: /var/

Rename the file to "config.json" and
update the file with your database
settings and a random salt for password
security. DO NOT USE THE DEFAULT!

3. Import data.sql into your database.
	
3. Register for an account and make your 
account active in the database. By setting
'active' = 1.

4. ???

5. Profit!

=====================================
EXTRA STUFF:
=====================================
A: By default users are not automatically
active and must activate via email. If you
want to send out VALID emails for activation
you must update lines 98 - 100 in:

./includes/functions/users.inc.php

B: To disable user registration update your
settings table in your database and set
allow registrations to 0.

C: At this time there is no forgot password
function, this will be added later, you can
set this to 0 to disable the link to it
from the homepage.

D: I want users to be able to register with
no activation email. Can I do it?

Sure... insert a line like the one below on line
123 in ./includes/functions/user.inc.php

$sUser->uActive = 1;
